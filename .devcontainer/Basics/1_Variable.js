// There are three types of variables ie. var, let  const

/*1. const: this variable cannot be modified if once initialized.
eg const a = 10;
a = 20 (wrong)
 */

/*2. var: It was the first variable and only used in old programs . 
It is globbally accessible variable. 
eg. var a = "Radhe Krishna"*/

/*3. let: It is most probably in use and the value can be modified, it's scope is block based 
ie.(inside {})*/
